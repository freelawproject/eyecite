emphasized as follows:
[E]xclusion of the witness for failure to strictly comply with the
pretrial order is indefensible. The trial court’s discretion to exclude
a witness whose name has not been disclosed in a pretrial order
cannot be exercised blindly or strictly, but is to be guided by a
determination as to whether use of the undisclosed witness will
prejudice the objecting party.

STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS
The undisputed facts as evidenced by the Plaintiff's Affidavit (attached hereto
as Exhibit

(Plaintiff's
Request for Admissions of Genuineness of Writing and Truth of Facts, Request for
Production
and Interrogatories attached hereto as Exhibit 2) are as follows:
1 The Defendant entered into a credit agreement with the Plaintiff. Plaintiff's Affidavit
and Defendant’s failure to answer Plaintiff's Request for Admission Number 1.

3 Payments on the account are in default. Plaintiff's Affidavit and Defendant’s failure
to
answer Plaintiff's Request for Admission Number 6.

STATEMENT OF LAW AND CITATIONS OF AUTHORITY

Pursuant to the terms of 12 O.S.§ 3236, a party may issue a Request for
Admissions to
another party regarding any fact that is relevant to the controversy. The
failure to deny the
Request for Admissions within thirty days will result in the requests being deemed
admitted. 12
O.S. §3236(A). The Plaintiff served the Defendant with a Request for Admissions seeking
admission of the balance on the account, the liability of the Defendant and that payments
were in
default. The Defendant failed to respond within the time allowed by law.
The Defendant
therefore is deemed to have admitted the existence of the account, that payment
s are in default
and the amount of the balance due on the account.
Where it appears to the Court that there is no genuine dispute as to a material
fact and that
one party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the Court should enter
summary judgment in
favor of that party. 12 O.S. CH. 2 App. Rule 13, Weeks v. Wedgewood Village.
Inc. 554 P.2d
780 (OkL 1976).
Since the Defendant is deemed to have admitted the
existence of the account, the balance
owing, and the fact of default and the Plaintiff's
Affidavit and confirms those facts, all of the
elements necessary to entitle Plaintiff to judgment are establi
shed and the Court should render
judgment pursuant to 12 O.S. Ch. 2, App. Rule 13 in favor
of the Plaintiff in the amount of
$6476.74 with costs of this action."""
