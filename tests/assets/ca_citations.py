memo_test = """For an order to be appealable under subdivision (a)(5), it must (1) have been made after judgment and (2) affect the substantial rights of the People.  (People v. VonWahlde (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1187, 1193-1194 (VonWahlde);  1238, subd. (a)(5).)  Though an eligibility determination2 is an order following judgment, it does not affect the substantial rights of the People.  For an order to affect the People's substantial rights, it must alter the judgement, its enforcement, or the defendant's relationship to the judgment.  (People v. Benavides (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 100, 105 (Benavides).)  An eligibility determination alone alters none of those things, and is hence unappealable.3  An eligibility determination is merely the first step in a two-step process.  A consideration of the risk a defendant poses to public safety, followed by resentencing if that risk is not \"unreasonable,\" is the second step.  (People v. Haynes (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 997, 1004 (Haynes).) """
