VonWahlde (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1187, 1193-1194 (VonWahlde);  1238, subd. (a)(5).)  Though an eligibility determination2 is an order following judgment, it does not affect the substantial rights of the People.  For an order to affect the People's substantial rights, it must alter the judgement, its enforcement, or the defendant's relationship to the judgment.  (People v. Benavides (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 100, 105 (Benavides).)  An eligibility determination alone alters none of those things, and is hence unappealable.3  An eligibility determination is merely the first step in a two-step process.  A consideration of the risk a defendant poses to public safety, followed by resentencing if that risk is not \"unreasonable,\" is the second step.  (People v. Haynes (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 997, 1004 (Haynes).) """

Not on Disputed Facts, Damages Will Be Certain Under Section 3287(a)
In Collins v. City of Los Angeles (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 140, the court stated, “[A]
legal uncertainty concerning the measure of damages rather than a factual uncertainty . . . does
not prevent damages from being ascertainable.” (Id. at p. 152 [emphasis added].)
In Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Sequoia Ins. Co. (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 1285
(Hartford), the court held that raising multiple competing theories regarding the damages
calculation does not preclude a finding of ascertainability:
Assuming Hartford was entitled to recover damages, the only question remaining
was how the trial court would prioritize the policies ... . This was purely a question
of law since the amount of damages under either formula was readily ascertainable
by mathematical calculation.
(id. at p. 1307.) “[W]hat was crucial in Hartford was that the choice of methodology was a legal
issue, not a factual issue.” (State of California v. Continental Ins. Co. (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th
1017, 1040 (Continental).)
In this case, the most significant damages disputes concerned: (1) the applicability of
Civil Code section 3334; and (2) whether certain expenses should be “above the line” or “below
the line” under an NOI analysis, specifically, depreciation, debt service costs, and legal
