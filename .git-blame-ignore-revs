# This file lists commits that changed large sections of the code and are best
# ignored by git blame (which tools like PyCharm use for their "annotate"
# feature).
#
# To use this file, go to the root of this project, and run:
#
#    git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# That'll tell git to use this file. For this to work, you need Git 2.23.0
# (released late 2019) or later.

# Run pre-commit
