    the (non-prescriptive) requirements of the `eyecite.models.ResourceType`
    type. By default, eyecite uses an extremely thin "resource" object that
    simply serves as a conceptual way to group citations with the same
    references together.

    This function assumes that the given list of citations is ordered in the
    order that they were extracted from the text (i.e., assumes that supra
    citations and id citations can only refer to previous references).

    It returns a dict in the following format:
    ```
        keys = resources
        values = lists of citations
    ```

    The individual resolution steps can be supplanted with more complex logic
    by passing custom functions (e.g., if you have a thicker resource
    abstraction that you want to use); the default approach is to use simple
    heuristics to narrow down the set of possible resolutions. If a citation
    cannot be definitively resolved to a resource, it is dropped and not
    resolved.
